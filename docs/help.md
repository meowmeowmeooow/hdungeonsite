## ❓ Frequently Asked Questions

??? question "How can I see the server?"
    Check out the `#rules` channel, which will contain instructions on how to see all the channels.

??? question "Why can't I send GIFs?"
    Due to spam, GIFs are limited to new members. By levelling up (or boosting), you unlock the ability to use GIFs and play games.

??? question "How can I get more colours and roles?"
    Levelling up!

??? question "How can I level up?"
    You can level up fastest by posting media (images, videos, and GIFs), or by speaking in `#lounge`.
